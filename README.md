# EIT_Project

Dear Ian and EIT Students,

this project is about the Classroom Management and Attendance App (CMA). I have uploaded all the current files and projects about this app.

I will continue my work with this app and upgrade the files after a while. Have fun and feel free to work with the codes.

Instructions to work with the CMA App:

1. Download and Install Android Studios on your Computer/ Notebook (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
2. Download all Project Files
3. Import the Project in Android Studios
4. Connect your Android Device and Start the App with the green play Button on the top.
5. Select your connected Device or create a new virtual device with the 'Create New Virtual Device' Button and press 'OK'
6. Use the App on your virtual/real Device
